SUPPORT FOR THE MAP API: REQUIRED ELEMENTS

DATABASE (Torey):
	Each Building will require (at minimum:
		1. Name
		2. A string of form "lat, lng" (I have a list of these available)
		3. (web?) address for attached page
		
		

NATIVESCRIPT SHELL (YZ): 
	The map uses a <div> with the id="map" as a viewport to run. We can work together to configure its size. You should be able to take the <script> from my html page and run it in-app if you create a <div id="map"> element, I think.

	
MAPS (Miles)
	I need to move the script section to a javascript file that loads with the page. The current organization is messy.
