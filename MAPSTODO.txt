STARTING THE APP:

Open a console at the BuildingAPI directory and run "npm start"

If you haven't installed mongoDB, follow this installation tutorial:
https://docs.mongodb.com/v2.8/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/
OTHERWISE: 
run mongod.exe from the mongoDB bin in program files.

Start an emulator (I use a nexus 5X on API 25.)

run tns android start from the stateofcampus directory.
